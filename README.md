## Fake News Prediction with Logistic Regression

### Introduction

This repository contains the code for a Fake News prediction system using Logistic Regression. The code is based on a Jupyter notebook originally generated by Colab.

### Functionality

This code performs the following tasks:

* **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, nltk etc. for data manipulation, text processing and machine learning.
* **Data Preprocessing:**
  * Loads the training data (`train.csv`) into a pandas dataframe.
  * Handles missing values by replacing them with empty strings.
  * Combines author name and title into a single "content" column.
  * Separates the data (content) and the target label (fake/real).
  * Applies stemming to reduce words to their root form and removes stopwords (common words like "the", "and").
  * Converts textual data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorizer.
* **Train-Test Split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
* **Model Training:** Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
* **Evaluation:**
  * Evaluates the model's accuracy on both training and testing data.
* **Prediction:**
  * Makes a prediction on a new unseen piece of text data (example from the testing set).
  * Classifies the news as Real or Fake based on the prediction.

### Running the Code

This code is intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment. You can follow these steps:

1. Download the code and data files.
2. Open the `Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* nltk
* scikit-learn
